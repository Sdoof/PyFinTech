\title{Close Location Value}
\usage{
CLV(HLC)
}
\arguments{
\item{HLC}{Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
High-Low-Close prices.}
}
\value{
A object of the same class as \code{HLC} or a vector (if
\code{try.xts} fails) containing the Close Location Values of a
High-Low-Close price series.
}
\description{
The Close Location Value (CLV) relates the day's close to its trading range.
}
\details{
The CLV will fall in a range of -1 to +1.  If the CLV is +/-1, the close is
at the high/low; if the CLV is 0, the close is directly between the high and
low.
}
