#'On Balance Volume (OBV)
#'
#'On Balance Volume (OBV) is a measure of the money flowing into or out of a
#'security.  It is similar to Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution.
#'
#'OBV is calculated by adding (subtracting) each day's volume to a running
#'cumulative total when the security's price closes higher (lower).
#'
#'@param price Price series that is coercible to xts or matrix.
#'@param volume Volume series that is coercible to xts or matrix, that
#'corresponds to price object.
#'@return A object of the same class as \code{price} and \code{volume} or a
#'vector (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the OBV values.
#'@note OBV is usually compared with the price chart of the underlying security
#'to look for divergences/confirmation.
