\title{Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution}
\usage{
chaikinAD(HLC, volume)
}
\arguments{
\item{HLC}{Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
High-Low-Close prices.}

\item{volume}{Vector or matrix of volume observations corresponding to the
\code{HLC} object.}
}
\value{
A object of the same class as \code{HLC} and \code{volume} or a
vector (if \code{try.xts} fails) containing the accumulation / distribution
values.
}
\description{
The Chaikin Accumulation / Distribution (AD) line is a measure of the money
flowing into or out of a security.  It is similar to On Balance Volume (OBV).
Developed by Marc Chaikin.
}
\details{
The AD line is similar to OBV; the difference is that OBV sums volume
multiplied by +/- 1 if the close is higher/lower than the previous close,
while the AD line multiplies volume by the close location value (CLV).
}
\note{
The Accumulation/Distribution Line is interpreted by looking for a
divergence in the direction of the indicator relative to price.

data(ttrc)
ad <- chaikinAD(ttrc[,c("High","Low","Close")], ttrc[,"Volume"])
