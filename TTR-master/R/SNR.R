#'Signal to Noise Ratio
#'
#'The n-day SNR for a given market is calculated by taking the absolute
#'price change over an n-day period and dividing it by the average
#'n-day volatility.
#'
#'\deqn{SNR_n = \frac{|C_t - C_{t-n}|}{ATR_n}
#'}{SNR = abs(Cl - lag(Cl,n)) / ATR(HLC, n)$atr}
#'
#'Using average true range as the volatility measure captures more of the
#'intraday and overnight volatility in a way that a measurement of
#'Close-to-Close price change does not.
#'
#'The interpretation is then relatively intuitive: an SNR value of five
#'indicates that the market has moved five times the volatility (average true
#'range) over the given look-back period.
#'
#'@param HLC Object that is coercible to xts or matrix and contains
#'High-Low-Close prices.
#'@param n Number of periods for moving average.
#'@param ... Other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{ATR}}.
#'@return A object of the same class as HLC or a matrix (if try.xts fails)
#'containing the signal to noise ratio.
